## Hi there 👋🏾

I'm Adi! Thanks for stopping by! I’m a recent Computer Science graduate from Carleton University.

💻 I like coding in 🌐 JavaScript, ☕ Java and 🐍 Python!

✨ I recently worked on an LLM-powered restaurant virtual hose called [Be Our Guest](https://github.com/AdiChops/be-our-guest), built using Cohere's API, as well as Python.

🔨 I'm currently working on my [personal portfolio website](https://adichops.github.io).

⚡ Fun fact: I co-host a podcast called [**commented out**](https://linktr.ee/commented.out) (but we're on kind of a hiatus now)!


Feel free to [reach out to me!](mailto:aaditya.chopra@carleton.ca)
