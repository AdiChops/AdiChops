## Hi there 👋🏾

I'm Adi! Thanks for stopping by! I’m currently a Computer Science student at Carleton University.

💻 I like coding in 🌐 JavaScript, ☕ Java and 🐍 Python!

✨ I recently worked on a text-based battle game called [Battlehauz](https://github.com/AdiChops/Battlehauz), coded in Java!

🔨 I'm currently working on my [personal portfolio website](https://adichops.github.io).

💼 I’m open for Summer Internships!

⚡ Fun fact: I co-host a podcast called [**commented out**](https://linktr.ee/commented.out)!


Feel free to [reach out to me!](mailto:aaditya.chopra@carleton.ca)
